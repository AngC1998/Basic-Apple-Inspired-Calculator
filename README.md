Status: Calculator finally somewhat functional since JavaScript isn't functionally properly on PC, so removed JavaScript file and put the functional script into HTML file. Calculator is mostly-functional, need to work on a few buttons, but should be fine for now. Need to work on correcting the functionality of '%' button, and maybe add in some extra buttons such as exponential and log buttons. Added in some easter eggs into calculator. Added extra buttons for front-end, but need to work on back-end for buttons.
