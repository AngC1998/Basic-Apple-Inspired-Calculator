Status: Calculator finally somewhat functional since JavaScript isn't functionally properly on PC, so removed JavaScript file and put the functional script into HTML file. Calculator is mostly-functional, need to work on a few buttons, but should be fine for now. Finally fixed '%' button after figuring out the problem. Added in some easter eggs into calculator. Added extra buttons for front-end (and also worked on back-end as well), but need to work on back-end for more buttons. Already dealt with most single-numerical input functions/buttons of calculator along with fixing decimal problem and getting Deg/Rad and 2nd buttons working. Now need to get multiple-numerical input functions/buttons of calculator working (currently working on this problem rn).
